2. Sign in and redeem your voucher code for 1000 credits so you can use ArcGIS Premium services.
3. Start labs:
   - Option 1: Follow the Data, Design, Develop labs.
   - Option 2: Pick a lab set. 
   - Option 3: Pic your own set.
   
## Data, Design, Develop

This pattern will show you how to take advantage of the ArcGIS Platform tools, data and map storage capabilities to build applications fast and effectivley. If you are new to ArcGIS, this is a good place to start.

#### 1. Data
 - [Import data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/import-data/)

#### 2. Design
 - [Style feature layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/style-feature-layers/)
 - [Configure popup-ups](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/configure-pop-ups/)

#### 3. Develop
 - [Display a webmap](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/display-a-web-map/)

## Lab Sets

### Mapping Tools and Scripting Labs

These labs are all about getting your data, layers and maps ready for your applications. This includes importing data, styling and sharing layers and creating maps. The more work you do here, the less you need to do in your application.

 - [ArcGIS Online](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=ArcGIS-Online&topic=any)
 - [Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=Python&topic=any)

### Programming Labs

These labs are all about solving specific programming task. Be sure to start with the [Create a starter app](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/create-a-starter-app/) lab as this will be used for all of the remaining labs.
