## Welcome to the ArcGIS GeoDev DevLab

Follow the sections below to start building a real-world mapping application with the ArcGIS Platform. Here are the accompanying resources:
  * [DevLab Slides](https://slides.com/alaframboise/geodev-devlab/)
  * [ArcGIS DevLabs](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs)

## Getting started

Before you start you need to sign up for a *free* developer account if you don't already have one. This will give you the ability to store maps, layers and data in the cloud and use the ArcGIS Premium Services.

1. Sign up for a [developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/sign-in/).
2. Sign in and redeem your voucher code for 1000 credits.  TUCSONDEVLABOCT2018

## Part I: Create a mapping app

These labs will show you how to use the ArcGIS Platform tools, data and map storage capabilities to build applications quickly. If you are new to ArcGIS, this is a good place to start. Be sure to follow them in the order below.

### Labs

  1. Data
     - [Import data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/import-data/)

  2. Design
     - [Create a web map](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/create-a-web-map/)
     - [Style feature layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/style-feature-layers/)
     - [Configure popup-ups](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/configure-pop-ups/)

  3. Develop (JavaScript developers will need a [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) account)
     - [Display a webmap](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/display-a-web-map/)

If you are finished early, try more [Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=ArcGIS-Online&topic=any), [Design](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=ArcGIS-Online&topic=Styling-and-Visualization), [Develop](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=any&topic=any) labs.

## Part II: Extend your app

These are sets of labs that you can explore to learn how to add additional functionality to your mapping app. For example, learn how to add geolocation, search and driving directions to your app. These labs can be completed in any order.

### Labs
  1. [Toggle the basemap](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/select-a-basemap/)
  2. [Add search capabilities](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/search-for-an-address/)
  3. [Expand the legend](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) (no lab, use JS API documentation)

## Challenge: Build a responsive app with Calcite Maps (Bootstrap)

There are many options for building responsive apps, but if you want to try to build an app with a web framework that uses Bootstrap, then give this a try. The easiest way is still use a web map. Visit [https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps) for sample code and more details.
